# Municipal Data Analysis and Visualization with Tableau
## Project Objective:
This project aims to analyze municipal data, including population density, waste generation, and urbanization levels, using Tableau to create interactive visualizations that provide insights for improved urban planning and waste management strategies.

## Questions KPI'S
-Which municipalities have the highest waste generation per capita?
-Is there a correlation between population density and waste generation?
-What is the percentage composition of different waste types (e.g., paper, plastic, glass)?
-How does waste generation vary between urban and rural areas?
-Which type of waste contributes the most to the overall waste volume?

## Tableau Project Process
